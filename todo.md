# Todo List

1. Generating binary tree from array representation (DONE)
    - also create the algorithm (create array from binary tree)
2. Generating DOM elements (SVG elements) from binary tree 
    - Drawings nodes
    - Drawing edges between nodes
    - Formatting position of nodes for normal tree view
    - Formatting position of nodes for compact tree view
3. Create new nodes from mouse clicks
    - Hover-over area under node to see a faint node
    - Click to add the node to the DOM and the tree
4. Click a node to edit its value
5. Right click a node to remove it (and its children)
6. Add form at top of page:
    - input array representation
    - generate button
    - have animation/focus to show when the field changes
    - handle invalid inputs
